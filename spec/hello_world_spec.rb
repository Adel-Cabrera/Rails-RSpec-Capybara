# The 'Hello world' part is an arbitrary string and could have been anything.
# In this case we have something extra in our describe block, type: :feature.
# The type: :feature setting does have a functional purpose. It's what
# triggers RSpec to bring Capybara into the picture when we run the test.

  # we were to replace "scenario 'index page'" with "it 'index page'", this
  # test would still function the exact same way, although it would arguably
  # read much less naturally. "scenario" is just syntactic sugar for "it".

    # to RSpec and Capybara's English-sentence-like constructions often
    # have difficulty remembering when two words are separated by a dot or
    # an underscore or parenthesis, myself included. Don't worry, you'll
    # get familiar over time.
